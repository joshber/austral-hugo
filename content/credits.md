Our logo comes from a photo of the Volcán Corcovado, viewed from the beach at Quellón, on the southern tip of the island of Chiloé.

The Los Lagos and Aysén regions of Chile feature Validivian (temperate) rain forest abutted by volcanic cordillera and pampas. This is among the least built-up parts of the Pacific Rim. This area will be the site of the Austral Residency.
