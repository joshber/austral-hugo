title: "La Residencia austral"
---

A place of refuge for scientists, writers, documentarians, artists, crafters, and anyone doing work that demands sustained attention in head, heart, and hand. Open to practitioners from any discipline, any nationality, any background. Off-grid residencies in a remote setting in the south of Chile, awarded via open application.

We are building a circle of patrons to help us buy land and erect our first cabin. Curious? [Get in touch](mailto:info@australresidency.org).

## Lo que pretendemos

Writing a grant? Finishing a book? Editing a film? Experimenting with a new way of looking at data — or of posing questions? Looking for new inspiration as a performer, composer, environmental artist, or chado practitioner? Simply burnt out? Our goal is to create a place free of the noise of contemporary life, where the only urgent thing is the work itself — that, and the weather.

In return, we ask that you keep a notebook in whatever format and medium makes sense for you. It could be something you write, or daily recordings (of ambient sound, luminous flux, seismic activity), or a series of experiments. It could be a row of cairns you build outside your cabin.

Our long-term goal is to fund all our residents. In the near term, we commit to working with you to make your stay possible.

## Quienes somos

We are three individuals with varied backgrounds in the cognitive and behavioral sciences who feel the time is ripe to try something new: a new way of practicing science, a new way of bringing science and other ways of looking at the world (art, craft, philosophy, ritual) into rapprochement — not through superficial collaboration but through an alignment of setting and mood.

All three of us, in different ways, have drawn inspiration from the conventions of the artists’ residency. The Austral Residency is a hypothesis: residencies are not just for artists. We would all benefit from focused periods of retreat that encourage you to be present not just for your work but for the world that does not care about us, the world before, after, and beyond the anthropogenic world that we spend our lives in. There are still places where humans are insignificant. These places do not need us — but we need them.

**Josh Berson** is an anthropologist. His work focuses on integrating an enactive (sensorimotor) view of cognition into a deep-historical perspective on niche construction. His first book, **Computable Bodies**, won the 2016 PROSE Award in Language and Linguistics. His next book, **Meat**, will appear in 2019, and **Lucidity** (a novel) and **The Scaffold** with luck in 2020. In 2018–19 he is an inaugural USC Berggruen Fellow at the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles. In his spare time he makes [procedural sound](https://github.com/joshber/sndspc).

Our logo comes from a photo of the Volcán Corcovado, viewed from the beach at Quellón, on the southern tip of the island of Chiloé.

The Los Lagos and Aysén regions of Chile feature Validivian (temperate) rain forest abutted by volcanic cordillera and pampas. It is among the least built-up parts of the Pacific Rim. This area will be the site of the Austral Residency.
