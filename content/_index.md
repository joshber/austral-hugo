La Residencia austral — The Austral Residency

A place of refuge for scientists, writers, documentarians, artists, crafters, and anyone doing work that demands sustained attention in head, heart, and hand. Open to practitioners from any discipline, any nationality, any background, working independently or in an institutional context. Off-grid and muted-grid residencies of two to four weeks in a remote setting in the south of Chile, awarded via open application with rolling review.

We are building a circle of patrons to help us buy land and erect our first cabin. Curious? [Get in touch](mailto:patronage@austral.FIXME).

Writing a grant? Starting (or finishing) a book? Editing a film? Experimenting with a new way of analyzing data — or of posing questions? Looking for new inspiration as a performer, composer, environmental artist, or chado practitioner? Simply burned out? Our goal is to create a place free of the noise of contemporary life, where the only urgent thing is the work itself — that, and the weather.

In return, we ask that you keep a notebook in whatever format and medium makes sense for you. It could be something you write, or daily recordings (of ambient sound, luminous flux, seismic activity), or a series of experiments in data analysis. It could be a row of cairns you build outside your cabin. Whatever form it takes, we ask that you leave a trace behind for those who come after.

Our long-term goal is to be able to fund all our residents. In the near term, we commit to working with you to match funding to make your stay possible.
