# La Residencia austral â€” The Austral Residency

A place of refuge for scientists, writers, documentarians, artists, crafters, and anyone doing work that demands sustained attention in head, heart, and hand. Open to practitioners from any discipline, any nationality, any background, working independently or in an institutional context. Off-grid and muted-grid residencies of two to four weeks in a remote setting in the south of Chile, awarded via open application with rolling review.

We are building a circle of patrons to help us buy land and erect our first cabin. Curious? [Get in touch](mailto:patronage@austral.FIXME).
