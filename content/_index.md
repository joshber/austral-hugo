# The Austral Residency

A place of refuge for scientists, writers, documentarians, artists, crafters, and anyone doing work that demands sustained attention in head, heart, and hand. Open to practitioners from any discipline, any nationality, any background. Off-grid residencies in a remote setting in the south of Chile, awarded via open application.

We are building a circle of patrons to help us buy land and erect our first cabin. Curious? [Get in touch](mailto:patronage@austral.FIXME).
