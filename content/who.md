title: "Who We Are"

We are three individuals with varied backgrounds in the cognitive and behavioral sciences who feel the time is ripe to try something new: a new way of practicing science, a new way of bringing science and other ways of looking at the world (art, craft, philosophy, ritual) into rapprochement — not through superficial collaboration but through an alignment of setting and mood.

This is a time of institutional flux. The hegemony of the university as a place of knowledge-making is in decline, along with respect for forms of expertise based on the careful sifting of evidence. Indeed, the pressures of everyday life are inimical to the careful sifting that all creative labor, epistemic, expressive, and craft-based, demands. This is not a new problem, but it is newly salient, and it calls us to experiment with new ways of arranging our working lives.

All three of us, in different ways, have drawn inspiration from the conventions of the artists’ residency. We’ve wondered whether these might be productively extended to other ways of making sense of the world. The Austral Residency represents a hypothesis: residencies are not just for artists. We would all benefit from focused periods of retreat that encourage one to be present not just for one’s work but for the world that does not care about us, the world before, after, and beyond the anthropogenic world that we spend our lives in. There are still places where humans are insignificant. These places do not need us — but we need them.
