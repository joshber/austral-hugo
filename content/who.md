title: "Who We Are"
---

We are three individuals with varied backgrounds in the cognitive and behavioral sciences who feel the time is ripe to try something new: a new way of practicing science, a new way of bringing science and other ways of looking at the world (art, craft, philosophy, ritual) into rapprochement — not through superficial collaboration but through a congruence of setting and mood.

All three of us, in different ways, have drawn inspiration from the conventions of the artists’ residency. The Austral Residency is a hypothesis: residencies are not just for artists. We would all benefit from focused periods of retreat that encourage you to be present not just for your work but for the world that does not care about us, the world before, after, and beyond the anthropogenic world that we spend our lives in. There are still places where humans are insignificant. These places do not need us — but we need them.
