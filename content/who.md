title: "Who We Are"
---

We are three individuals with varied backgrounds in the cognitive and behavioral sciences who feel the time is ripe to try something new: a new way of practicing science, a new way of bringing science and other ways of looking at the world (art, craft, philosophy, ritual) into rapprochement — not through superficial collaboration but through a congruence of setting and mood.

All three of us, in different ways, have drawn inspiration from the conventions of the artists’ residency. The Austral Residency is a hypothesis: residencies are not just for artists. We would all benefit from focused periods of retreat that encourage you to be present not just for your work but for the world that does not care about us, the world before, after, and beyond the anthropogenic world that we spend our lives in. There are still places where humans are insignificant. These places do not need us — but we need them.

**Jose Hurtado** bio goes here.

**Josh Berson** is an anthropologist. His work focuses on integrating an enactive (sensorimotor) view of cognition into a deep-historical perspective on niche construction. His first book, **Computable Bodies**, won the 2016 PROSE Award in Language and Linguistics. His next book, **Meat**, will appear in 2019, and **Lucidity** (a novel) and **The Scaffold** with luck in 2020. In 2018–19 he is an inaugural USC Berggruen Fellow at the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles. In his spare time he makes [procedural sound](https://github.com/joshber/sndspc).

**Daniel Margulies** is a tenured researcher with the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in Paris. After receiving his PhD from Humboldt University in Berlin, he led the Neuroanatomy & Connectivity Research Group at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig. His research addresses principles of organization within the cerebral cortex and their implications for cognition.
