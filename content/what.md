Writing a grant? Finishing a book? Editing a film? Experimenting with a new way of looking at data — or of posing questions? Looking for new inspiration as a performer, composer, environmental artist, or chado practitioner? Simply burned out? Our goal is to create a place free of the noise of contemporary life, where the only urgent thing is the work itself — that, and the weather.

In return, we ask that you keep a notebook in whatever format and medium makes sense for you. It could be something you write, or daily recordings (of ambient sound, luminous flux, seismic activity), or a series of experiments. It could be a row of cairns you build outside your cabin.

Our long-term goal is to fund all our residents. In the near term, we commit to working with you to make your stay possible.
